# picowalker Design Document

## Goals

People should be able to build the hardware themselves, then load the code onto the pico and have a working device.

Alternatively, a second version which can fit into the original Pokewalker form-factor.
This would require SMD components so not so easy to build at home.

## Software

Pico C code to add drivers to support `libpicowalker-core.a`.

In the end, it would be nice if multiple peripherals or even boards could be supported so try to keep all specific device/driver code separate, but this isn't a must right now.

## Hardware

Completely open to suggestions.

Proposed hardware (for prototyping at least):

- Main controller (Pico)
- LCD screen 96x64 2-bit greyscale
  - SSD1327 128x128 4-bit greyscale oled is best I can find for now.
  - [AliExpress SPI](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32920538010.html)
- IrDA interface
  - Mikroe IrDA 3-click (breadboard development) [Mouser](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/Mikroe/MIKROE-2871?qs=f9yNj16SXrKCBoWeEAc2vQ%3D%3D)

  - MCP2122 UART to IrDA encoder [Mouser](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/Microchip-Technology-Atmel/MCP2122T-E-SN?qs=php1hWwkCL7dJgtHA%2FdIXg%3D%3D)
  - DSC1001CL1-001.8432T clock oscillator [Mouser](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/Microchip-Technology-Atmel/DSC1001CL1-001.8432T?qs=yDQnu9hAfI%2FtBK%252Bb6vr8lA%3D%3D)
- Accelerometer
  - Bosch BMA400 SPI [Mouser](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/Bosch-Sensortec/BMA400?qs=f9yNj16SXrKBoguHUc32eQ%3D%3D)
- External EEPROM
  - ST M95512 (128-byte page size, same model as pokewalker) [Mouser](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/STMicroelectronics/M95512-DWDW4TP-K?qs=gNDSiZmRJS8kMWQ2whknqA%3D%3D)
  - 64K 25LC512 (128-byte page size)
  - 128K 25LC1024 (256-byte page size, if you want extra storage) [Mouser](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/Microchip-Technology-Atmel/25LC1024-E-P?qs=0R2K%2FH4DmMNuJO3S%2F11Ktg%3D%3D)
- Control buttons
- Speaker
- Rechargeable battery
- 3D printed case

I would like for multiple types of component to be supported in the future, since some may be easier to get a hold of than others, but for now getting a prototype is the goal.

## Wiring diagram

```raw
Pico           Peripheral
----------------------------
17 (GP13) ---- Button left
19 (GP14) ---- Button middle
20 (GP15) ---- Button right
 6 (GP4) ----- OLED SDA
 7 (GP5) ----- OLED SCL
```

Buttons have a 1k pull-up resistor.

SDA/SCL have a 4k pull-up resistor.

Everything runs on 5V DC, but 3V3 should probably be used in the portable version.
